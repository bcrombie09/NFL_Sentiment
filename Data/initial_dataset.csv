105,2023-09-10,1694388520,173,Im not usually a doomer but that was genuinely a disgusting fucking game The most disappointing thing wasnt how poorly some of our players performed but that our gameplan was a total regression to 2021 levels across the board How fucking long is McVay gonna do this to Pete? Bend dont break meanwhile our offense sees the ball 1-2 times a quarter because we give them the middle of the field for free How many fucking times have we lost games from the time of possession difference? Nothing has changedThe injuries are extremely unfortunate and after the tackles went down we got steamrolled by Donald and co because we have the worst o-line depth in the NFL I dont blame Geno for any of that because he had no chance but he was still underwhelming overall ie missing Bobo for a walk in TDOur offensive gameplan looked like shit even before the injuries We barely moved the chains and even when Geno had protection our vaunted receivers seemed to be locked up DK and Lockett were great in spots but DK pulling that stuff at the end of the game is the same shit different year Its getting old - I fucking hate the Rams too but dont let them win that way I felt like we didnt structure our gameplan for JSN around his strengths at all TEs were solid as always which is nice Charbonnet didnt do much but Dallas looked pretty explosiveSome real positives are that Walker looks like he hasnt missed a beat He was explosive and we shouldve used him more to control possession before we got down too much He was chunking I think Riq looked good and made some plays - Stafford avoided him for the most part Mafe looks extremely exciting and was our best d-lineman this game Bobbys presence was sorely missed although hes clearly lost a couple stepsI cant think of much else Im just extremely disappointed On to Detroit Go HawksEdit Oh yeah how could I forget the moldy ass Swiss cheese secondary that got completely fucking exposed save for Riq I know the d-line was shit but they dont have any excuse considering their lofty expectations I dont know how much of it can be attributed to the shitty gameplan but we need Jamal and Spoon back immediately because that was super disappointing,Seahawks,19:28:40,-0.9463,0.177,0.676,0.147

494,2023-09-11,1694443334,52,I keep seeing people rebutting the claims that the offense looked better and that we have a step to build on by mentioning that we had only 16 points and you cant win a game with 16 points Well we only had 6 drives yesterday The second lowest amount of combined drives so far was over 18 If we extrapolate our data to the second least amount of drives of 9 for a single team then we see a game that ends 25-23 In 2022 the average was 109 per team per game If we extrapolate the data to average then we see a game that ends 31-27 With the amount of drives each team had it was a generally well scoring gameSo what we need to change is our pace and playcall We cant have two 8 minute drives like we did last night Our defense isnt strong enough to play a gritty low scoring game Dink and dunk play was working but we need to stretch the field We cant only run plays that put the ball in the hands of TEs and RBs on short routes Im interested to watch Tim Jenkins to see if this was a Russ problem or Sean problem,,10:42:14,-0.6055,0.08,0.852,0.067

505,2023-09-10,1694388524,52,Before the game I thought to myself well we can settle for being the second best team in the division the 49ers are uncatchable Now being beaten by the Rams I just think this is going to be an insufferable year Now we get to the part that people will try to tone down losing this first game of the season against the Rams This is a bad Rams team that outplayed throughout most of the game If we lose to this team we are just another bad team in the NFL People are going to say that our defense is going to get better because we are getting Adams and Witherspoon in a couple weeks But this has been the talk for like what? 5 6 years? No DLine pressure linebackers being beaten in the middle by tight-ends and cornerbacks missing tackles and lefting wide receivers wide open for easy completions mainly on 3rd downsThis offense is not good enough to carry the corpse of the defense Our OLine is serviceable we have a great team of wide receivers but it is not going to cut Once we get in a position where running is irrelevant we are not going to win games I am still going to give the benefit of the doubt to Geno and the unit but the 2nd half was most likely the worse in the last 10 years of this teamNow we go to Detroit to play a great Lions team that improved a lot in comparison to last year This is what i expected from our team Improvement And I only see the same miserable game from the past 5 years A poor defense that sometimes bend and dont break but mostly stays on the field for too long and an offense that has to play catchup to maintain us in the game Thinking back I believe this game was even worse than the normal Seattle Seahawks experience because usually we kept the games entertaining until the end Now we got beaten hard against a bad team and never managed to get back to the gameWhat a great season ahead of us,Seahawks,19:28:44,-0.6975,0.15,0.712,0.138

I mean hes top 5 and got that big boy contract now right?Last night for us wow monsoon game out there We took care of business Pass offense left some to be desired but we saw a lot of guys getting open and good separation This game was honestly a great look at the type of offense McCarthy wanted to run compared to Kellen No unnecessary hero ball We came out for the first time on offense with 13 points up already and just went immediately in to ball control mode Put Ferguson and Hendershot in front of the fucking ball machine until they catch 100 in a row That was ridiculous Two dropped TDs and a good 6 or 7 dropped passes between them have them do that shit until they cant NOT catch a pass Shit was obnoxious,cowboys,8:35:45,0.7876,0.107,0.763,0.131

1039,2023-09-11,1694444686,25,My takeways- Tatically speaking offense is already way better than last year You may find that weird as we only put 16 points against that below average defense but consider that from the 6 drives the offense had we got 2 TDs with 1 missed XP 1 FG 1 missed FG and 2 punts We can be better than this of course but I think we have another problem- This one is probably overreacting but Im starting to think we severely overestimated the talent on this offense Our QB is washed our WR corps the ones that didnt got hurt are average at best Same with the OL which I think its actually below average at best why Cushenberry is still here? TEs are ok the main one got hurt RBs are the best we have and still not the greatest- Why did we get rid of McManus again? He had a down year yes I agree but to trade for Lutz? Cmon- Is this the year of the defense downfall? Missed tackles poor secondary play non-existent pass rush Theres a lot that needs to improve Patrick Surtain is still precious thoOverall not great Bob Lets hope they bounce back next week,,11:04:46,0.9797,0.149,0.619,0.232

AT is that only good player on the line JMS is a rookie so hard to judge at this point But the guards are trash and Neal is looking like a bust The fact they didnt address the line more is concerning The only focus going forward should be getting better pieces for that line or firing the o line coach The o line looked like revolving doors I would love to see the average time to throw for DJ because it seemed to be less than 15 seconds No QB can be consistently successful in those conditions The funny part too is this isnt new Even back to Eli I remember us being on here saying this exact same shit The GMs for this team waste first round picks on busts and flashy positions instead of taking care of the most important part of the football team the o line,NYGiants,7:49:20,0.9582,0.084,0.768,0.148

1243,2023-09-11,1694393236,21,Nick burning his timeouts in the second half and then going for that 4th and 2 in the situation was brutal There was no chance of faking out the defense to get offsides and no going back if they didnt have the look Getting way too fing cute with it when they played extremely conservatively the rest of the game Ill chalk it up to weather and the fact that had an immediate lead due to the defense But sometimes it would be nice to open up the jets and put it on a team when were rolling End of the day 1-0 without injuries is the only thing that matters Im happy and we all should be Now lets go knock the lights of out the VikingsEdit I stand corrected on the 4th and 2 point- I now realize I was wrong because they could have still taken the delay of game and punted Still dont like it though But we won Go birds,eagles,20:47:16,0.4705,0.101,0.787,0.112

1387,2023-09-11,1694433918,18,A couple thoughts from someone at the game whose opinions really dont matter that much1 Jerome Ford needs to change his number boy that is confusing 2 We as a fan base need to stop with the chubb chants Based on my analytics over the last three years anytime we chant his name the next carry is a one yard gain or a loss of yards3 Also as a fan base Im ashamed at how many bengals fans were at that game We have the chance to be really good and it would be so much better if the opposing team didnt have such a loud cheer whenever they do something4 That defense fucking ROCKS That is all As I said my opinions dont mean much go browns and everyone have a great start to your weekEdit to add point 5 FTSEdit again I think Im just crazy with point three so feel free to disregard it completely my idiocy is astounding at times,Browns,8:05:18,0.9558,0.079,0.75,0.17

Why were most passes short or medium routes? Where was the uptempo offense? Is that all due to the playbook still being incorporated or due to bad playcalling?Also aside from a few plays it seemed like Russ had a decent amount of time to throw which was encouraging,,10:39:40,0.7059,0.122,0.734,0.145

Or heck most QBs available for nothing on practice squads?  Thats before even mentioning the fact Dobbs was probably getting cut and would have likely also been available for nothingTo be clear Im on team tank Im not mad we started a bad QB Im mad we gave up a 5th round pick to start a bad QB when we already had plenty of those at least two of which I feel have more upside  Even if we werent tanking it just didnt make sense if we are tanking its the sort of move bottom 5 GMs in the league make,AZCardinals,16:59:34,-0.8854,0.101,0.833,0.066

2116,2023-09-10,1694379692,11,Ridder is going to have to improve a lot Play calling is also  Need to install some designed qb runs because he is not going to do it on his own and if the defense has to respect the possibility of him running they cant sell out to the rbs as hard and they cant blitz he himself as hard  It doesnt seem like he is going to do it organically so might as well design and call some like they did in CincinnatiHe HAS to contribute in the dual threat sense  or else it makes no sense to stick with him  He was not drafted to be a pocket passer only In fact if he didnt have the rushing stats he did in college he probably wouldnt have been drafted  I think Smith is trying to force him to be creative and improvise but i just dont think he is that type of QB so might as well do it by design cause him being a pocket passer is not going to cut it  Especially when Heinicke is probably better at that and on the benchI think they should make gettig him going on qb runs a priority because him just being a one dimensional passer is not going to cut it  Not even in this division Cause the fact is both Mayfield and Carr had decent games and we wont win the division without getting more from the QB1,falcons,17:01:32,0.8691,0.046,0.863,0.091

2196,2023-09-10,1694381057,11,Im beginning to worry that the KAM/KOC duo is going to go down as a failure  While I agree with the cuts that were made this off season several of them long overdue nothing KAM has done has shown that he can identify talent or negotiate value well  With Cine and Booth both buried and Ingram one of the worst players we have seen out there I think we can fairly say his first draft was a failureAs for KOC the offensive whiz just hasnt been the case  Last year was an improvement but is it really hard to beat the Zimmer years offenses? I get that the interior oline is bad but you have bookend tackles a top flight TE and a TE2 that would start in half the teams along with the best WR in football an extremely serviceable wr3 and wr4 and a guy you just picked in the 1st as your wr2  There is no excuse for the repetitive playcalling and lack of creativity we keep seeing not to mention the failure to do anything to scheme help on the interior olineAnd then we have Kirk who despite wanting to improve with age like Brady just is what he is at this point an aging qb with a good arm but who is a completely unaware statue in the pocket whose decision-making swings from aggressive gunslinger to hesitant schoolgirl at the worst possible timesIf Im the Wilfs Im telling KAM/KOC that they get one chance to find their QB this next off season  This team had a real chance to win the SB when they signed Kirk and have chased that closed window for too many years since  Its time for the next era of Vikings football  Shore up the interior oline and you have a dream scenario for a rookie QB to step intoOn the other side the defense was not the problem today and that credit rests with Flores  I hope we can keep him somehow but unless he truely has been blackballed by the league I think he is a HC next yearHeres to hoping next week isnt the spanking most everyone expects,minnesotavikings,17:24:17,0.9188,0.107,0.757,0.135

2423,2023-09-10,1694390203,10,Post game notes- First half offense looked alright but needed to finish in the endzone not kicking FGs - Hopefully our tackles are back ASAP because our backups and competent pass pro arent going to find each other- Was Lockett hurting or something? After his second catch or so he seemed irrelevant wonder if he got banged up on one of those short ones- Was worried with Reed as our NT now we see the IDL is bad A positive for them is that the OLBs managed to look even worse than them -- netting hardly above 0 pressures- As I was downvoted for when we re-signed Bobby him and Jordyn continued to give up passes over the middle same issue as when they were paired together prior to Bobbys departure- Tre Brown may have flashed a tiny bit before his injury but after that it is clear that he is not a starting NFL CB at all- Artie Burns is still bad- Julian Love had a couple good plays but other than that looked like a complete liability in zone- Our passing defense scheming is getting frustrating We have these situations like 2nd and 15 and were literally just giving them half the yardage for free and praying we make the tackle right after Why the hell are we not challenging defensively?,Seahawks,19:56:43,0.7315,0.146,0.683,0.171

When weve seen that one of the keys to beating teams like the chiefs is keeping the ball longer and keeping their offense off the field? Especially since in your words our defense cant stop anything?Dont tell me Im using arbitrary stats and then go use a stat that doesnt have any logical reasoning as to how it might separate a good offense from a poor one,,11:54:29,0.4268,0.1,0.771,0.129

Yes absolutely and we definitely \should\ have won but the NFL has a lot of parity and inferior teams win all the time Every win is important and good We are 1-0 but from some of the game thread comments youd think we just blown out 2 Our defense looked very strong today We were going up against a rookie quarterback with a beat up O-line but we still held an NFL offense to 9 points You really cant ask for more than that even considering the competition level Because of injuries we have on paper one of the worst CB rooms in the league but they played at a competent level which is actually a huge win3 Zay Flowers and the passing weapons look LEGIT I couldnt have asked for a better game from Zay Get Mandrews back and these are 100 the best weapons Lamar has had in his career&ampx200BTHE COPE&ampx200B1 We had a lot of sloppy penalties But week 1 for EVERYONE is sloppy Even if penalties are a problem for this team it just WILL NOT be as bad as it was today Well tighten the screws up and be FINE This is not that predictive 2 I genuinely thought that Lamar played fine One of the fumbles was sloppy and his fault but the one in the backfield was a massive fluke Fumbles are the flukiest plays in all of football there is no reason to believe that this will be any more of an issue going forward than it ever has been He still threw 17/22 and genuinely I thought that when he had even a little bit of time he played great clean football We made some adjustments with the routes we ran in the second half and it paid big dividends Lamar is still our guy and while he didnt play up to his standards it really wasnt as bad as you may have thought After all he still had the best QB performance in the division by a mile lol&ampx200BTHE BAD&ampx200B1 The injuries are terrifying I am very sad for JK  Theres not really much of a positive way to spin the injuries we got today I hope some of them like Linderbaum can come back soon but who knows Its as scary as everyone was saying2 The O-line play overall today was rough I did think we fixed it up a little bit in the 3rd quarter which let Lamar cook some but the O-line was by far our worst position group today It will have to improve if we are going to beat good teams All of Lamars weapons wont mean anything if hes running for his life or God forbid gets injured because he keeps taking hits &ampx200BBut overall other than the injuries I am relatively pleased with the performance today We made a lot of FIXABLE mistakes and still won 25-9 I just dont think that anyone should be acting like a doomer after a 25-9 win Be happy guys,ravens,16:37:12,0.9974,0.102,0.685,0.213

2741,2023-09-11,1694436410,8,The opening drive is funny to look back in hindsight because Jones didnt even try to pass They dropped back and immediately had him tuck and run They picked up a personal foul penalty and it mightve been their longest play of the day,cowboys,8:46:50,0.3182,0.061,0.832,0.108
2742,2023-09-11,1694436993,8,it isnt that he cannot do it consistently Dak is one of the best QBs in the NFL  The system Dak was in the last 6 years has been bad but it is not readily apparent without some studyYou saw it today with the Chargers in their lossKM designs those plays so you can maximum yardage with the most open WR  Dak would have to stand back there and pat the ball until a WR comes open on long slow developing pass plays When it works it looks amazing lots of yards and 30 points a game But the downside is that those plays are all big plays so you have a lot of 3 and outs too So you give the opponent time to keep up with you and games turn into track meets Sound familiar? How many times did we let a team with a 3rd string QB beat us or keep up with us in scoring?How many years did Dak lead the league in tight window throws? He cant stand back there forever and pat the ball so he has to speed up the throw before the WRs can break their routes off or scramble to get open That leads to a lot of high thrown balls or tipped passes that can lead to INTs  It is a huge flaw in KMs system and one that has not been addressed in San Diego Watch for Herbert to start racking up a ton of yards and 20 yard plays but keep an eye on the opposing team scores and how many INTs he is going to get Tonight was a reinvention of the offense that Rodgers ran in GB for so many years Efficient passing or attempts at least in the rain nice balance of running the ball and occasionally taking your shots downfield to keep the safeties and DBs out of the boxThis offense works well because if you have a great front 7 your DBs will have to man up against our WRs and we are going to win that battle almost 100 of the time Drop your LBs back in coverage and Pollard will tear through your DL for 20 yardsIt is time for people to understand that McCarthy knows what he is doing DQ is going to end up in the HOF for his defensive schemes and coaching and Bones is among the best of all time We have 3 HOF coaches multiple SBs between them and this team is finally without the influence of Linehan/Garrett/MooreBe ready for a lot more happy days to come,cowboys,8:56:33,0.9943,0.032,0.836,0.132

2745,2023-09-11,1694445813,8,Honestly this was just a really really weird game for multiple reasons Its kinda hard to extrapolate too much from it I do feel reasonably encouraged by the progress on offense especially points per drive though But its maddening the D and ST have taken steps back for reasons that were entirely our own making losing Evero and McManus,,11:23:33,-0.7383,0.173,0.744,0.082

2747,2023-09-11,1694449426,8,I agree with all of this but the QB/RB parts In the first half he looked great and I think this is a game that is a small step to getting his confidence back The only concerning thing to me was the lack of deep balls We got one major play on a pass interference It is so critical for this offense to stretch the field and yesterday they just could not do it after Dulcich left the game With the lack of deep ball threat the defense can clamp down on the run game which makes the running backs look worse than they are All in all this offense has a long way to go but I think they can get there &ampx200BCourtland Sutton is going to go down as one of the all time greatest disappointments in franchise history He has everything he needs to take the next step and he just hasnt He has had so many opportunities to step up and become the guy and he just cant He will never be a super star like we all thought he could be and its time the front office comes to terms with this,,12:23:46,-0.3661,0.138,0.738,0.124

2749,2023-09-11,1694450508,8,I honestly feel we are so thin talent wise But also this really is only the first week and there are some positives like you mentioned around the offense 1 Pass rush is non existent - we need browning healthy and Gregory to step up huge this season We were so spoiled to have von Chubb ware and shaq these past seasons - it feels like there is no pressure when we have them on 3rd and long 2 Despite pass  rush it seemed like D was much more physical than any outing last season 3 I think the O will be a little better with jeudy out there there were some real nice moments for the run game which has me excited Also the fact Russ despite not posting the stat line looked great under Paytons guide I am excited and ready to be hurt again,,12:41:48,0.992,0.038,0.687,0.275
2750,2023-09-11,1694454591,8,Were seeing the results of 4-5 years worth of bad drafts catching up to us We whiffed on picks so we spend huge FA money to quickly plug up holes with average players Because of this were always operating under the perception that were a fringe playoff team - its been this way since VJ Even though weve had top 10 picks four times since 2018 apparently were just a QB away from perennial playoff contention - which is why we traded the farm for RussBecause of this window with Russ and the abysmal failure with Hackett we traded more picks to get Sean Payton Then we spent even more money to bring in FAs Our top picks from the last 2 drafts are Nik Bonitto and Marvin Mims Jr - lets be honest neither of them are moving the needle for this roster any time soonWere in a perpetual state of retooling and reloading when this roster really needs a complete tear down and an actual rebuild People hate the term tanking but if youre completely overhauling the roster and resetting through the draft - youre going to lose A LOT of games We have middling expensive talent and a window thats quickly closing with a declining QB on a huge contractTeams stay winning by building through the draft and getting more darts to throw to add talent Cheap rookie contracts with team control of up to 4-5 years Sacrificing first round picks and the inability to add top-end draft talent will result in what were seeing now& a real lack of young talent and difference-makers on both sides of the ball,,13:49:51,0.9141,0.055,0.844,0.101
2751,2023-09-11,1694451473,8,Not to be unduly negative but I think there are several counterpoints to the passing games positive vibes We had two catches by WR in the second half our YPC was not impressive at all and the play-calling was still questionable To add some nuance to the discussion one of my concerns about the game was that we were the recipient of what were essentially two turnovers the lost fumble that wasnt and the punt that wasnt and we did not capitalize on those opportunities Furthermore getting stuffed in the redzone AND moving backward out of field goal range on separate drives is enough for me to seriously question our offensive playmaking,,12:57:53,-0.8128,0.136,0.8,0.064
2752,2023-09-08,1694165182,8,I think our offense is probably the most rusty coming out of training camp with not  many of the starters playing that much Everyone looked a bit rusty for both teams on that regardGoff had an ok game Marvin was badcHiEfs RT was badI think the whole unit will be betterSill cant wait for Jamo,detroitlions,5:26:22,0.25,0.034,0.897,0.069

3129,2023-09-11,1694391397,7,What a win seemingly all the fears were assuagedCould the Rams line hold up? That was an emphatic yes Stafford remained clean and better yet we were more physical on the goal lineCould the receivers produce in the absence of Kupp another emphatic yes All receivers made plays and even left a lot on the field However the Rams possessed the playmakersWould Stafford overcome his health issues and resume form? Yes yes yes he looked great and diced up the defense He wasnt perfect but more than good enough Could the rams establish the run Yup and Mcvay stayed committed too Also it seems the draw will be a much larger part of the offense Could the young defense contain the touted Seahawks passing attack? Yes the secondary did an exemplary job and seemingly got better as the game progressed The run defense wasnt stellar but also improved as the game continued on At one point deep in the 4th the Seahawks had 3 yards in the second half Not everything was perfect Our kicking game doesnt inspire confidence However it wasnt disastrous Our pass rush is going to be a problem If Donald can get tripled team someone else has to win Even though we got some sacks late  that was an ideal game situation for rushing the passerOverall I say A performance lets not forget this was a road game in one of the toughest stadiums against a division rival and everyone wrote us offCongrats to the coaching staff for having our young team ready to play and for the players for executing so well,LosAngelesRams,20:16:37,0.9872,0.087,0.708,0.205

I saw him not catch a ball that probably wouldve ended the game but other then that8 What tf was going on with our OL? I get the Pats D-Line is good but my goodness why were they THIS bad9 Its hard to credit Slay for that pick-6 but I appreciate him staying in bounds and going for it seeing the stagnate offense that decision probably won them the game10 Shoutout JD for getting that FF and 05 sack with Sweat If he wants to take that next step our interior is gonna be dynamite,eagles,20:45:07,-0.8317,0.172,0.664,0.165

3423,2023-09-11,1694436194,6,Look I am usually hyper-critical of the Boys and play designs I am the first one to call them out even on good games when there are glaring issue that should be addressedBut you are missing the boat completely here1 Daniel Jones did throw outside the hashes and when he did Diggs and Gilmore made him pay with 2 TOs and a Defensive TD for his effort2 Dak was very sharp tonight after the 1st Quarter Everything he was throwing in the first was sailing really high I think it was his nerves and just trying to do too much in the rain He really seemed to settle in towards the end of the 1st Most of the issues tonight were from Kadarius Ton  the TEs not hanging on to the ball Hendershot and friends are all really good TEs It was pouring rain most of the night the TV shots did not capture just how much rain was falling It was a mess3 The inside run game is potentially problematic but that RB is Saquon Barkely with quads the size of a literal tree-trunk  The fact he ran for 14 times and only finished with 52 yards 0 TDs is elite level run defense They did just fine We are going to give up a 90 yard rusher a couple of times this year Every single defense does every year It doesnt mean your defense is bad its just how it goes sometimesThis was as clean of a game as you are going to get all year Sloppy gross weather conditions Special Teams Defense and Offense all scored What more do you want? Dak to throw for 500 yards and 4 TDs while Pollard gets 3TDs and 100 yards while we get 15 sacks and block every punt and FG?What will people gripe about then? That Dak threw too many times? Pollard shouldnt have been running so much? Micah should be on the bench after his 5th sack?If you are not happy with this game and the absolute domination the Cowboys put on display tonight you are not going to be happy with any game the rest of the season no matter the outcome,cowboys,8:43:14,0.2474,0.076,0.846,0.078
3424,2023-09-11,1694452538,6,Keep seeing this being parroted but its selective memory The defense last year regressed significantly once Chubb was traded and Darby got hurt Everyone was hyping up Mathis this off season but I never bought in Cause I remember last year He had some good games yea but he def struggled as well I was never confident in him as the full time CB2 starterDarby may not have been Great but there was/is certainly a huge step down from him to Mathis So my point is what we saw yesterday isnt cause Evero isnt here Vance wasnt the issue Evero wouldve struggled as well with Mathis getting beaten on every single play and zero pass rushWe also lost KWaun Williams for a few weeks Hes really good The lack of Chubb KWaun and Darby is why the defense looked like it did yesterday Not Vance Joseph Its not his fault Mathis couldnt cover Also our Defensive Line got manhandled on most passing plays,,13:15:38,0.5597,0.139,0.686,0.175
3425,2023-09-11,1694447118,6,I wouldnt mind a bradley roby signing after watching Mathis yesterday If the offense can move the ball like it did yesterday and we actually hit some kicks we might suck slightly less,,11:45:18,-0.34,0.131,0.802,0.067
3426,2023-09-11,1694458492,6,A huge part indeed the biggest part of the issue is simply this The Broncos are not that talented not at all close to the level the fanbase has deluded itself into thinking  The talent they do have is almost universally injury prone which becomes a wash since theyre barely ever on the field and theres very very little depth,,14:54:52,-0.0319,0.079,0.844,0.077
3427,2023-09-11,1694451717,6,That definitely wasnt a deep ball by any stretch of the imagination although the possibility for 50 yards after the catch was there,,13:01:57,0.4019,0.0,0.891,0.109
3428,2023-09-11,1694451494,6,Instead of beating a dead horse I wanna talk about a few things I have not seen mentioned per se While the play/hit was talked about basically the most critical call of the game I still have so many questions If it was such a dangerous hit why wasnt the play reviewed to see if KJax should have been thrown out of the game If he led with the crown of his helmet like the announcer said why wasnt he disqualified? Simmons tried to do the exact same thing to Jimmy G in the first half and was flagged for it We all know Sean Peytons history is this the sort of playstyle we can expect? Are these boys headhunting or is this just what comes to mind because of Bountygate? From what I saw the hit on Jacobi was legal though brutal He was not a defenseless receiver as time can be an element considered after the catch He was going for the sticks and Kjax was trying to prevent him from getting there It was a violent collision and the receiver was definitely concussed but there is absolutely no way you are going to 100 prevent this in this gameOn the other hand the Simmons hit was the complete opposite To me it looked like Justin was trying to take Jimmy G out of the game There absolutely is a difference between the two situations and these boys are paid millions of dollars to be out there they spend countless hours practicing technique and studying film There is no doubt in my mind Simmons was aware of the situation QBs are protected Jimmy G slid Justin hit him with very pour technique rather than moving his head to the side he moved his head down to specifically initiate contact with the crown of his helmet On a sliding QB It is obvious he was trying to knock Jimmy G out of the game and that is the only reason he hit him like that On top of that the angle he hit him was super dangerous with contact on the top of the helmet compressing the spinal column He absolutely could have ended Jimmy Gs career with that hit not to mention his life That hit was bull shit and Justin is way better than that Finally lets talk about Marvin Mims Jr This kid is absolutely looking every bit of his draft position and more He almost broke that kick return and it wasnt just a freakishly athletic play He was in exactly the position he was designed to be in that wedge following his blocks and it almost paid off The kid has some great hands showed he has an understanding of the game and showed no hesitation being thrust into a starting position  Imagine having a WR that can catch the ball with his hands? He looked nothing like a rookie and you love to see his poise He is going to be great for this team 55 yards on Kick returns yesterday,,12:58:14,0.9829,0.065,0.819,0.115
3429,2023-09-11,1694452290,6,At least the doomers arent mentioning the OLine I would say that speaks volumes Give them couple weeks to mesh and they are going to start taking over games and willing this offense to success McGlinchey is such a  beast I hope Schlereth speaks up for these men because they deserve it Crosby is every bit of a gamebreaker and even though his presence was felt they minimized his impact,,13:11:30,0.6542,0.03,0.883,0.087
3430,2023-09-11,1694443108,6,I was both surprised and unsurprised to see that Russ only had 177 yards passing I felt like he played better than that but also thats just been who he is in the last year Looks fine but ultimately is underwhelming hes very likely not the answer and I think we need to draft a QB as early as we can in 2024,,10:38:28,0.7227,0.0,0.865,0.135

3491,2023-09-11,1694434130,6,I think the best part of yesterdays game is that it felt like we stunk for a majority of the game and we were down in the 4th quarter but we didnt give up and put up 31 points  Say what you will about rookie QBs but Richardson looked scary for at least the first half of the game  We had two fluke turnovers by our rookie too but Tank redeemed himself with that heroic charge on that 2nd and 4 to get the first down when he should have been tackled for a 2-3 yard loss  This team just has that belief in itself that everyone no matter the stature can and will overcome mistakes from earlier and for the first time it feels like that belief is not misplaced  Defense clamped down when it needed to in the 4th Trevor looked dynamite from start to finish Zay had that incredible touchdown reception Ridley looked like a human cheat code on the field Engram is making good on his new deal Etienne is still a warrior and even our O-line got it together in the 4th quarter after a rough start  THE REAL Josh Allen feasted yesterday  Playing the Chiefs when were 1-0 feels a lot better than if we were 0-1  Now were on to next week our first real test of how good of a team we really are  Chiefs Bengals Bills and Niners  If we go 2-2 were legit  If we go 3-1 were super bowl contenders,Jaguars,8:08:50,0.9715,0.065,0.798,0.137

3826,2023-09-10,1694384118,5,Yeah- I get that- but honestly this argument supports taking a knee more than running the ball imo Especially because Houston was bringing a lot of zero the screen was way more likely to pop than a run That said I get what you mean and agree that time and 3 were probably more valuable than 7 That said if they handed it off I would have said why not just take a knee,ravens,18:15:18,0.9166,0.043,0.768,0.189

3837,2023-09-12,1694526027,5,I personally take it as him thinking he needs to carry the team when the game isnt moving in the right direction Hes passionate about winning but he needs to settle down and remember 4 yard passes win games too He never should have thrown those bombs in double coverage and I blame both him and the OC for itI would not describe it as selfish or for glory  I have a 23 year old stepson who is now a professional athlete and he would cut off his right arm if it won the game,buffalobills,9:40:27,0.8885,0.085,0.748,0.167

3839,2023-09-12,1694539232,5,Theres a lot of truth to this His first successful series last nightwhen he and the team drove down the field and put up the first 3 was when he did just that He picked apart their defense as he moved down the field but their defense held up and wouldnt give him the endzone so they had to settle for 3 That was a good drive by Josh and the offense done against a good D The Jets defense made some adjustments on the next drive and started getting after Joshhate to say it but they got in his head and got him rattled to the point where he wasnt playing the game on his terms- they were dictating and he wasnt exploiting the vulnerabilities they were showing as oftenHe does need to work on breathing and not panicking or entering Hero ball mode as often He also needs to be able to rely on his line to protect him which he clearly hasnt been able to do for awhile They need to work on that,buffalobills,13:20:32,0.9832,0.022,0.8,0.179

3842,2023-09-12,1694529626,5,In Joshs post game he said it felt eerily similar to last year and I hate that it felt the same So part of me worries that this kind of ate at him in the off season and he came into this game anxious and full of doubt Hopefully he can break out of that mindset very quickly because that shit can spiralHes the kind of guy that will go for a deep pass fail then want to redeem himself Im hoping he can complete his next deep pass for that redemption and just brush this loss off I dont think its a matter of shocking sense into him its getting him out of this mindset that his mistakes are carrying over from last year Just gotta relax and play his game,buffalobills,10:40:26,-0.929,0.166,0.749,0.085

3917,2023-09-12,1694498718,5,Our front office has sucked for years Theyve spent decades wasting money and talent searching for superstar quarterbacks and lack any patience to develop players Im regularly getting downvoted on here for saying it but I trace most of these issues back to overpaying for Wilson If we hadnt given Wilson such a huge contract we could have kept a lot of talent on both defense and offense I mean can you imagine if we had gone with a quarterback that we only had to pay 100 mil and then put 75 mil into keeping talent at other positions and the other 75 mil into the offensive line? Thats not even taking draft picks into account At this point the gross mismanagement makes me feel like our team is being run by someone playing fantasy football So much over-emphasis on a few key players and positions and a complete neglect of all the other things that actually let those players look like superstars And releasing McManus? Come on they didnt even trade him so they could get something out of the deal They literally just threw money away and left the team in a worse position,,2:05:18,-0.3736,0.111,0.789,0.1

4102,2023-09-10,1694377719,5,The Good The defense looked dominant in the first 28 minutes of this game just couldnt force a turnover Our own turnovers alone were a 13 point swing and the brain dead offsides on Special Teams was another 4 We spotted the Bucs 17 points in a game we lost by 3At the end of the day you cant take those plays out of this game so its a loss but you hope better coaching and mental preparation can clean those up in future weeksThe Bad From the final 2 minutes of the 1st half through the end of the game the defense looked like last years defense They couldnt get off the field and when they held on 3rd down it was short enough to be converted on 4th down or converted by a penalty The offense still is plagued by negative 1st down plays to fall behind the chains and Kirk is getting hit all gameMy takeaway This team has struggled to find defensive stars in the draft since 2015 and that really shows We dont have anyone blowing up the oppositions gameplan and making life hard for opposing QBs or WRs so we need to rely on scheme The offense lives and dies by Kirk Cousins who is probably the 7th best QB in the league when hes on and the 17th best QB when hes off JJ gets disappeared in the 2nd half but a lot of that is because our offense goes 3-and-out and then the defense gives up 7-to-13 play drives and we dont have a lot of possessions to squander,minnesotavikings,16:28:39,0.8872,0.116,0.738,0.146

4321,2023-09-11,1694404187,5,I dont like our defensive or offenses philosophies Yes you have to play the run honest But in this day and age stopping a team for a 2 yard run on first means almost nothing Getting 8 yards in to pass plays for most offenses is like candy from a baby Were all out there celebrating a run stuff on first down when theyve been getting chunk plays a 15 yards anytime they want it in the middle of the fieldIm not one of these guys always yelling we give them to bigger cushion but we have sent a blitz ones with two blitzers and our linebackers were still playing off as if they were going to run a double move down the seam or some thing They have to know the ball is coming out quickly and get up on the air guy Offensively I feel like our whole game plan is to actually TRY to get to 3rd &amp 4  In the modern game where office of lineman can hold and wide receivers cant be touched just go get the first down on 2nd &amp 8   Trying to get to 3rd &amp short is like always pulling your starter after six innings and expecting your bullpen to be perfect for three innings every time It means one dropped ball one bad route one QB pressure ends your drive Just go get the goddamn first down earlier And a 30 yard pass to DK on third and short is fucking nonsense Thats Russell Wilson bullshit Again it means one play where youre not perfect and your whole drive is ended Why not bootleg and roll out with multiple layers available to Geno?,Seahawks,23:49:47,-0.6511,0.119,0.769,0.112

4324,2023-09-10,1694389099,5,First things first this should clear up any notion that this team is a Super Bowl contender They are not Now for the offense This level of talent at the skill positions should not go one quarter without scoring much less an entire half They got what one first down the entire second half? Unacceptable The protection was shit before the tackles got hurt so thats not really an excuse Geno was fine most of the time but he needs to be better than fine if this team is going to go anywhere The offense as a whole had no rhythm whatsoever and they left an already suspect defense completely out to dryAs for said defense they stopped the run better than expected which was nice However that doesnt even matter much because passing on them was so free there was no reason really to run Did they contest a single catch? Did they ever have a meaningful pass rush snap?

4351,2023-09-10,1694379100,5,First game of the season I have been saying this for the past week that this was a 50/50 game for us and it would be telling based on how both teams performed  The fact we won this game means I am currently leading towards a 8-9 season our schedule is TOUGH with a floor of 6-11 and an absolute maximum of 10-7 with luck involved Now normally an 8-9 would be bad however considering we have been talking about this not being a rebuild but more of a refresh an 8-9 on season 1 with a new QB that was questionable means we are in decent condition to make other changes as necessary  The Vikings came out swinging as did we this was not a tank bowl this was a solid game played well by both teams this is why I have adjusted the floors and peaks as much as I have This is a SOLID WIN for Tampa Bay  Takeaways  Mayfield - Not bad early on you saw he was uncomfortable and it showed all over the place However once he got into a rhythm with the team plays were made I didnt see anything particularly spectacular but I did see some good basic football from him so room to grow but the potential is there  Palmer - This kid is going places hopefully stays with the Bucs but I am liking a lot of what I have been seeing from Preseason to this game keeping both eyes on this guy  Evans - This man needs to retire as a Buc and lets get him another 1000 yard season nuff said  Wirfs - Doing Wirfs stuff keeping that blindside clear as best he can looks like the position change had negligible effect if any on his performance  Mauch - He needs more game time but he did ok today I think with some coaching from Jensen he has raw potential to be a starting center for the forseeable future  Winfield Jr - What a game from him I have said this every year since year 1 with him he dad is a hall of famer and he will be too That guy has got some seriously good talent well done today  McLaughlin - OMFG we actually have a KICKER I legitimately do not know how to process this Awesome job today keep up the amazing work  Camarda - At this point do we ever expect to replace this guy over the next 6 years? That hangtime with the distance is just NUTS this guy is the real punt God    Offense Overall - 75/10  We need to work on our run game its not terrible but it can be better Baker should settle in nicely considering what I saw from him in the second half and if so the timing issues should get resolved thus increasing our field positioning and scoring potential O-Line is holding up well still things to tweak and work on if we could get anther 1- 15 seconds to Baker our offense could really make things happen  Defense Overall - 7/10  Our blitzing and close coverage is excellent  we are generating TONS of pressure and we are getting to the QB However our mid and long coverages are trash they needs LOTS OF WORK I think this pretty much sums it up short and simple  Special Teams Overall \- 95/10  I knocked off 5 because of the one return where we missed a few tackles that cost us about 15 yards and I am nitpicking here Special teams today was EXCELLENT we have decent returners we have an excellent punter and we actually have a kicker just wow    Final Thoughts -Keep in mind that these scores are just team scores against what I considered to be a 50/50 opponent and the scores/stats seem to project that it really was a 50/50 kind of game So WHEN we play a team like the Bills these 7/10s are gonna look more like 5/10s I do not think we are SB ready no where near it however us making it to the post season is a possibility if we do well enough and we shore up our shortcomings If our defense can tighten up that mid to long coverage and continue that short coverage with pressure  blitz package we could really take some teams by surprise this year,buccaneers,16:51:40,0.999,0.038,0.788,0.174

4365,2023-09-10,1694378781,5,The negativity comes from an offense that looks soooo lost that squandered an amazing opportunity from a defense that played incredibly well I have never seen a professional football team look this scattershot this stunned or this out of sync in 30 years of watching the game That doesnt mean they wont turn it around But is extremely frustrating for THIS to be the answer when you fire the GM let go of most of the offensive staff and somehow look WORSE,Tennesseetitans,16:46:21,-0.9488,0.232,0.68,0.088

4370,2023-09-10,1694381289,5,Yea my biggest critique of the offense today is inexperience and thats what they displayed There were moments where they showed various flavors Sam showed the ability to toss the ball over the middle the check down and try to push it down field He has to work on taking sacks ball security and reading pressure The OL was actually okay today better grade than most people would probably give them here but in perspective they gave Howell opportunities throughout today and they played well in the run game Though in certain moments we have to identify the pressure better first This team can be good but a lot is going to go as the offense goes the defense looks good and im sure they are going to look at todays tape and say they were beating themselves out thereEdit and I wanna say my biggest issue with the OL is they seemed gassed in the second half but i think the scheme actually helps them they werent perfect but workable? yes,Commanders,17:28:09,0.9731,0.078,0.722,0.2

4427,2023-09-12,1694538022,4,I think thats the problem Dorsey and McDermott keep telling Josh to play smarter slide take the check down etc but it doesnt register to him   Weve all seen countless interviews with Josh where he kind of laughs it off like yeah they tell me not to do that stuff but I still do itoh well So either McD and Dorsey arent really putting their foot down in their delivery of that message or Josh just doesnt care to listen to it   Either way its a coaching issue that needs to be fixed for this team to go anywhere,buffalobills,13:00:22,0.8741,0.047,0.809,0.144
4428,2023-09-12,1694538259,4,The Dorsey problem is not being able to get through to Josh to take the easier throws or get the hero ball out of his game  Good coaching can get Josh to minimize the stupid plays thats what were now seeing may have been Dabolls greatest asset,buffalobills,13:04:19,0.8979,0.097,0.618,0.285

4430,2023-09-12,1694524629,4,Im convinced Josh gets impatient and arguably bored if he doesnt feel like he is right in the action This is apparent when we seemingly move the ball ok and take easy 4-5 yard passes and runs and suddenly he is throwing into double coverage or trying to jump over 3 defenders It is a Josh Allen problem to fix but I believe his regression is driven in part by the difference in play calling styles from Daboll and Dorsey Josh finds Dorseys offense uninteresting at times With Daboll Josh found himself throwing the ball 15 plays in a row and us abandoning the run to a detriment but Josh was completely engaged I do not believe Josh is aligned with Dorseys decision making and makes poor decisions in turn Josh does not need to stop doing what makes him special He does not need to never run again never throw it deeper than 6 yards or never take a risk But if we have any hope of success this season he needs to take a long look in the mirror and align his brain with his talent Shit happens and it needs to be reigned in and it cannot continue to snowball,buffalobills,9:17:09,0.9305,0.096,0.752,0.153

4646,2023-09-11,1694452429,4,also tough to make an effective gameplan on D with no film on the version of the offense youre playing against this year Its why typically the Chiefs have an easy time in week 1 because they have a lot of new elements to their offense each year and enough weapons to execute them effectively especially when they had Tyreek tyreek is essentially the best Week 1 weapon ever createdif you can scheme brand new ways to get him a running head start and free-release consistently then the opposing D is in trouble There are still better ways to handle it than we did yesterday but it was a brutal first week matchupSimilarly it may also be why we saw a lot of running success yesterday because they chose to play pretty conservatively not knowing what our offense was going to look like especially with all the pre-season press about how we wanted to take big shots down the field and we hit them with an effective run game insteadThat said I also wouldnt be terribly surprised if the patriots are able to immediately counter the new wrinkles next week now that its on tape and because they have BB of course but I still think the Dolphins will find plenty of success here in the early season as they unveil the whole playbook and all the permutations using the same motion conceptsYou can certainly have great week 1 defensive performances as we saw many of them yesterday but that is usually helped by playing an offense that is out of sync to start the year for any number of reasonswe were not lucky enough to have that in the Dolphins,Chargers,13:13:49,0.9839,0.081,0.756,0.163

4927,2023-09-11,1694391832,4,Will somebody explain how the rams only run 4 plays against us and it works every time Deep in from an outside receiver any hitch anywhere ever run up the middle and long cross route Over and over for years Is it the Clint/Norton really calling soft zone and no middle coverage every time? Is it that all the rams plays look similar and they cant see what coming so theyre eating the bait of the last play over and over? Do all of our D linemen need to run to the same spot and get bunched together so they cant penetrate? Is that part of the plan or are they free wheeling? How can every rams hawks game looks the same with no change at all year after year? Even when we win its more of the rams offense screwing them selves over than us defending them Its just& been so long to watch the same bad plans against the same attack It hurts my brain,Seahawks,20:23:52,-0.6662,0.101,0.827,0.072

5027,2023-09-10,1694385967,3,To be honest I dont think we blitzed much in the second half the majority of the QB pressures were due to the pocket breaking down,falcons,18:46:07,0.25,0.078,0.811,0.111
5028,2023-09-10,1694381573,3,Yes This exactlyIt drives me insane that he has the speed to make defenses pay  but just doesnt have that instinct like most guys with that ability do Its kinda weird lolI just cant understsnd having tools like that and not using them So hopefully they can make up for it and actually design it for himStill like one play in particular the panthers were in man coverage and blitzed 4 and he stood like like a statue like bouncing up and down on his feet a little as the pocket insta collapsed  He should see the coverage and the blitz and pause for half a second and take off aroind the edge or slide throw the seam by one of the guards Just for the life of me cant figure out why hes so deadset on standing in the pocket like that Could i guess be a deer in the headlights type thing but you definitely dont want that from qb1His play improved a little and he calmed down when they started to call plays that had him moving outside the pocket by design So hopefully they can build on that and add in some designed runs as wellCuzz honestly  Its not going to get any  easier for him when teams see those tendencies on tape He will get wrecked  So yea hopefully they can change the approach a little and use him more like a dual threat cause its about the only way i can see him doing better and evolving going forward He had some okay runs in that one preseason drive but that was preseason and saw nothing like that this afternoon,falcons,17:32:53,0.9965,0.047,0.72,0.233
5029,2023-09-11,1694443838,3,They stated a few times they drafted him for his dual threat capabilities so hopefully they can find a way to bring out that part of the game more Should be able to say we wanna see you use your feet to exploit defenses when the opportunity presents itself and have him to it  But everything all at once was just a bit paralyzing to him at times yesterday  Maybe was too much in the moment to process it so they limited the playbook and what he could do until they could make some adjustments at half time  Idk Was one of the weirder things ive seen Ridder is definitely going to have to work on how processes things at game speed and his headspace in general You cant be own worst enemy when youre a QB Weve seen that scenario with Mariota and how that works out  If you make a bad play or wrong decision get over it and start new on the next play His split second decision making in rpo choices and things like that hasnt been the best I know once inside the 5 yard line they ran rpo and if he kept it he would have walked in untouched but he forced it to allgeier who got stuffed for no gain  He did similat things in the 4 game stretch last year Seems like he never chooses himself as the option in RPO and they need to work on that too Rn seems like the only way to fix is is remove the pass option and make qb run Cause only thing i think that can fix this is repetitionWhich is why it was dumb as hell not to play the offense but one drive in all of preseason They obviously were not ready  But yea id have im practice doing things to improve pocket awarenessworking on rpo and running out of the pocket whe  its man coverage People dont understand how much of a difference something as simple as the qb should run when its man coveragecan make  If thw qb takes off at rifht moment its guaranteed 10 or 15 yards at leastThen once does it a few times they become reluctant to play man  It can take one player out the play if he has to become spy and watch the qb The defense can fully commit to blitz or run stopping  anymore etc Just frustrates me how such simple thing he has the physical ability to pull off isnt being done Doesnt make sense lol,falcons,10:50:38,-0.9639,0.13,0.776,0.094
5030,2023-09-10,1694379532,3,1-0 Over 500 for the first time in years Bijan made an awesome cut to score a touchdown in his first game Allgeier did an amazing bounce outside move to score a touchdown as well Bates proved to be a huge pickup in free agency on defense and made Bryce Young look like a rookie thats what I was really hoping for I didnt want to hear the media slobber over him And it was so nice winning without it being some bullshit accidental win We actually straight up won this game by causing turnovers and running the ball well And while Ridder has a LOT he needs to be better at I will give him credit for making big throws in the fourth quarter Rise Up Go Falcons Enjoy the rest of your Sunday Dirty Bird Nation I especially like that we can watch the rest of the games happy because we won,falcons,16:58:52,0.9936,0.056,0.643,0.301

5376,2023-09-11,1694438945,3,My only real issue is a few throws where he just flat out missed He made the smart plays took what the defense was giving him Maybe I misspoke in that he wont win us games He was pretty clutch on 3rd and 4th down I think the scheme and route combinations helped guys get some yards after the catch to keep the chains moving His completion pct leaves a lot to be desired I get its his first full season as a starter and we went through the same shit with Rodgers and maybe the idea is to make him a game manager this year and let him continue to grow and develop and next year open him up some more,GreenBayPackers,9:29:05,0.4639,0.065,0.832,0.102

5512,2023-09-11,1694449291,3,McDaniels has spoken on it a little bit and its sounded like for at least the first half of the season were to expect Hoyer to be the backup as were able to do more with him given his familiarity not just with the system but in his experience seeing NFL defenses McDaniels can reasonably expect him to be able to put 2-and-2 together better than AOC will currently vs NFL defensesOnce we get toward the midpoint of the season itll be up to how AOCs been in practice meetings etc to determine whether he becomes the 1 backup an obviously important position on our team given Jimmy Gs proclivity for getting injured If hes showing hes starting to put it together then theyll of course be inclined to give him a shot  This seemed to be what Trey Lance never showed Shanahan in SF  never seemed to make clear to them hed really gotten it and you see how that went for him Even when not injured they seriously never seemingly had any confidence in him Just look &amp listen to how theyve been with Purdy,raiders,12:21:31,0.9502,0.017,0.873,0.11

5517,2023-09-11,1694462268,3,I put this one solely on Staley Murray was ass all game couldnt cover a chair and was asked to cover the middle of the field Any decent coach boots him out of the game and throws a safety in there to help cover that area Instead we get Murray reacting to the ball being thrown to a TE WR FB in the middle of the field while Murray is somewhere near the LOS I absolutely still think Kendricks was an upgrade at ILB but only if you have a competent cover LB next to him This offense is probably the fastest in the league but there is still no excuse for what happened yesterday Theyll put up points no matter what but yesterday Staley didnt do anything to stop what was going on,Chargers,15:57:48,-0.1076,0.064,0.888,0.047

5522,2023-09-11,1694455108,3,I get that line of thinking but its been two straight seasons where the defense over the course of those two seasons was below average Brandon Staley no longer deserves those benefits of the doubt anymore If this was a first year DC I wouldnt be hitting the panic button but the panic button has been hit since mid way through last season and they havent given me any reason to take my finger off the button since then,Chargers,13:58:28,-0.8573,0.158,0.762,0.079

5525,2023-09-11,1694452591,3,Fine margins won the game for the dolphins Jc jackson giving away the pass interference with 2 seconds on the clock and level scores was just insanity and without it the game was much more in our control Him not taking a knee in the endzone was also a head scratcher though I would still expect the boys to get at least 1 fresh set of downs so the punt could get some legs Was pleasing to see the run game being very effective but when we needed yards at the end we resorted to trying to throw deep but zero protection for herbert to work with Hopefully the D step up in the following weeks as I will back us to outscore a lot of teams this year We dont have to be great defensively just competent and we will win more than we lose Its game 1 lets not panic too much just yet,Chargers,13:16:31,0.9726,0.045,0.778,0.177
5526,2023-09-11,1694448284,3,Tyreek Hill week has been rough for years I still have to see more from this defense to call it a bust   Our offense looks very balanced  Good to see Parham getting some catches  Seeing us rush only 3 and then having the Dolphins get a huge play was frustrating   JC Jackson still being a starter on the team feels like an ownership decision and not a coaching one I have no facts to back that up its just what it feels like,Chargers,12:04:44,0.7739,0.074,0.771,0.155

5529,2023-09-11,1694460954,3,most of our losses this season will be because we got outcoached not because they had a better qb or defense or whateveryesterday our coach got cooked january 14 our coach got cooked hes gonna keep getting cooked this year its sad when we have such insane offensive weapons and a fairly good defense plenty of teams would kill to have a player like derwin on their teams and just keep eating Ls because of our playcallingif we win at all this season it will be despite our coaching not because of it,Chargers,15:35:54,-0.7402,0.168,0.702,0.131

5532,2023-09-11,1694450383,3,I dont want to say this but I guess it cant get worse than this We have to remember Miami has a damn potent offense still zero excuse for 600 yards but the thing that annoyed me the most is how much space Dolphins WRs had to catch the ball and the YAC was insane The telling story is next week against Tennessee They dont have as many weapons and we looked decent against the run JC caught a lot of flack but lets remember who decided to put him 1-1 against Hill JC shouldnt even be in this situation because by all means he still should be on IR His first game back wasnt amazing but there was some good to pull from it Herbo didnt have to have an amazing game because the damn run game destroyed Miami Im clueless why we didnt take off more time before our last score and try to run it in Miami couldnt stop it and instead we passed on 3rd &amp Goal or 3rd down cant remember and we should have pounded it in for an 8pt lead Offensive line was solid except for when it counted the most Gotta give Herbert time to make a play and his pocket collapsed at least 2x I hate that we lost how we did but Im glad it was just week 1 As Charger fans we can all align that we have seen and experienced the same or worse and we still find ways to be in the thick of it Its a long season and I wont call for Staleys head as of yet But I distinctly remember when Miami hired Vic as their DC I was pretty pissed I wanted him here in LA Staley will have some games to redeem himself soon but I think most are over him It was a humbling loss and Id rather have it now compared to week 13 or later in the season Lets all BTFU because we know we can be better,Chargers,12:39:43,-0.9825,0.15,0.768,0.082

5776,2023-09-11,1694439354,3,I dont think you are wrong everything about last night was worst case and the sequence of events from the AT false start to the pick 6 just deflated everything I think they wanted a run heavy offense and they were down so much so quick that the game script flipped and put an OL trying to find its feet against a juggernaut of a pass rush and it snowballed from thereIt would be crazy not to be worried about Evan Neal already but Ill give the the OL a few weeks before Im really panicked,NYGiants,9:35:54,-0.9259,0.15,0.837,0.014

5789,2023-09-11,1694431689,3,We need to invest heavily into both the offensive and defensive fronts I dont know how hard it is to understand that even David fucking Sills will get open if you give him enough time It kind of works on the opposite side of the ball too If your line is getting to the qb in a few seconds then your corners can be mediocre because they only have to play defense for a few seconds Dallas has been solid for a very long time because their fronts are so sound How we havent noticed that while continually getting our ass kicked by them I will never know,NYGiants,7:28:09,-0.3826,0.056,0.875,0.068

5987,2023-09-10,1694380999,3,This franchise is washed right now Tomlin may or may not continue the non-losing season streak but thats about it And the only reason that streak continued was an insane amount of luck in 1-score games over 2021 and 2022Kenny Pickett is not a good QB He had one good season at Pitt with Jordan Addison and the extra Covid year against a garbage schedule and parlayed it into a high draft pick But he is not close to being a franchise QB Defense is the same story as 2021 and 2022- outside of the three star players its garbage TJ had a great game but there are 10 other players on the field that need to do their jobThe best time to fire Canada was any point before today The next best time is right now,steelers,17:23:19,0.9642,0.059,0.778,0.163

5990,2023-09-10,1694381530,3,Its unrealistic because this ownership group is afraid to put any pressure on the guy and put him on a hot seat This team has underperformed for a decade,steelers,17:32:10,-0.296,0.073,0.927,0.0

6001,2023-09-10,1694383246,3,Aiyuk plays the same all the time  The reason he looks so good is because he finally has a competent QB who will throw him the ball when hes open  which is almost always,49ers,18:00:46,0.793,0.0,0.794,0.206
6002,2023-09-10,1694388188,3,I think Aiyuk leads the team in receiving yards again this season I think Deebo had a down year last year because Purdy has more chemistry with Aiyuk and teams are daring the Niners to throw deeper,49ers,19:23:08,0.3612,0.0,0.935,0.065

We got out-schemed but our DBs also got outplayed Pass rush - It didnt exist At all DK - Continues to show hell never be a leader in our locker room His taunting call de-railed a drive that couldve gotten us back in the game Its unlikely but I dont like him taking the opportunity away from the team O-line depth - After Abe and Cross went down their pass rush was as good as ours was bad Cant win that wayIts one game Better to get the wake-up call now Many of you are overreacting I expected to win too but you all know the Rams even pre-McVay give us trouble Add in the post-injury hunger from their best players and you get a tough game Our guys overlooked them,Seahawks,9:48:31,-0.8218,0.151,0.723,0.126

6285,2023-09-11,1694394968,3,There were obviously a lot of miscues but in between them I think this offense showed a LOT of promise    Howell made some bad decisions but he was also throwing darts all game    Bienemy needs to remind himself to run the ball often to help out his new qb especially when we were getting like five yards a carry early on  I think some of the success early on with the deeper passes is maybe what got Bienemy off pounding the rock when he did,Commanders,21:16:08,0.8006,0.075,0.779,0.146

6308,2023-09-11,1694442337,2,Im trying not to just throw out knee-jerk reactions and think about it logically but boy did ridder look like a deer in headlights out there I think even the coaching staff started to show their lack of faith when they ran the ball on that one 3rd and 5 rather than trying to let him make a play I really hope the kid works out and hes shown he CAN make some decent throws but if he has another 2 or 3 games like this I really think we ought to consider starting Heinecke Especially if we can maintain a 500 record or better in that time,falcons,10:25:37,0.9612,0.024,0.805,0.171

Defense was making plays then offense would come outridder couldnt help move the ball and they were getting bood but like i said they made adjustments and it worked They are keeping him on a leash like that cause its best for the team and they are obviously trying to avoid him going sour and collapsing like mariota did last year  Sure there was bad play calling in the first half but there was also bad decision making by ridder and probably even worse Frozen indecisiveness at times The entire point of the game is not losing lmaoAlso if you prefer them opening up with a gunslinger and taking risks  thats actually what Heinicke is known for Ridder not so muchIdk you talk anout the game like its madden Like teams can go out there and just toss it all over the place no regrets Just not realistic,falcons,19:15:21,0.5591,0.127,0.738,0.135

Given the current DB situation Williams may be one of the guys the D could least afford to lose  I dont know yet what the diagnosis for JK is but if it is the heel we may still be okay with Gus Hill and combination of Gordon/Mitchell when he comes off IR  Just gotta pray that Stanley and Linderbaum arent serious  Both looked like they walked off okay but you never know  Couldnt see what happened to Stanley but the video of what happened to Linderbaum was pretty uglyClowney is going to help the D if he can stay on the field,ravens,16:47:12,0.9044,0.069,0.804,0.127

6720,2023-09-11,1694441506,2,&gt How many years did Dak lead the league in tight window throws? He cant stand back there forever and pat the ball so he has to speed up the throw before the WRs can break their routes off or scramble to get open That leads to a lot of high thrown balls or tipped passes that can lead to INTsI would argue he just is not accurate consistantly he tends to throw behind or low or way too high A lot of times those passes are still caught so no one really raises any red flags but he creates some of those tight windows from late reads and throwing in spots that bring the defender into the play,cowboys,10:11:46,0.4883,0.041,0.9,0.059

7006,2023-09-11,1694456478,2,I expect the defense to be man heavy because JC Jackson and Mike Davis are press man corners and struggle in zone They got spanked yesterday but Im sure theyll play better against worse receivers,Chargers,14:21:18,0.6542,0.126,0.631,0.243
7007,2023-09-11,1694455572,2,Im encouraged by the team vs last years nothing to do with the defense The defense has been shit since the beginning of Staley Im not gonna overreact after 1 game vs an offense that torched everyone most of last season with a whole offseason to make the adjustment in week 1 I dont think any coordinator can prepare for what McDaniel threw at us yesterday but the constant single coverage on Hill was ridiculousDespite all that we left a few plays on the field and couldve won but thats been the same for the past 2 decades I feel like? Ive already accepted the team is cursed but curses can be broken so Im just along for the ride at this point Been a fan for long enough this feeling is nothing new and I just choose to be encouraged at this point,Chargers,14:06:12,0.9456,0.048,0.787,0.165

7010,2023-09-11,1694451367,2,even if they didnt know whether he caught it or not rushing to the line there is the right play because it forces the opposing coach to make a decision based on no information You introduce the element of two possible outcomes that arent present if you give the opposing team enough time to review and make an informed challenge call 1 The team challenges an obvious catch and wastes a timeout or 2 the team doesnt challenge and you get away with what should have been an incompletion,Chargers,12:56:07,0.1476,0.037,0.909,0.054

7015,2023-09-11,1694459088,2,They didnt get it done but Im of the opinion they had done enough by that point to win the game They matched the Dolphins 30 first downs and had scored on 6 of their 10 drives five of which were drives of 68 yards or longerThe key difference in this game was the pass rushers success at the end of game The Dolphins got home when they had forced Herbert into long yardage downs fourth quarter 2nd and 20  4th and 12 The Chargers did not get home when they were given the same advantage against Tua fourth quarter 3rd and 10  3rd and 15,Chargers,15:04:48,0.8674,0.034,0.859,0.107

7028,2023-09-11,1694457424,2,Im more in line with the GAC podcast guys take on the defense yesterday and their classroom analogy When an excess number of students are failing to pass a standard thats not individual failure that is failure from the teacher Yesterday was a failure of the defensive coaching staff more than the players alone Hearing The Athletic Football Show guys point out the dramatic change of playing &lt10 snaps in man coverage against Dolphins last year versus 50 snaps in man coverage yesterday is baffling Also a puzzling decision to put Jackson on an island against Hill for his first game back post major injury and rehab Jackson has disappointed but this coaching staff has botched his Chargers tenure so far too by failing to put him in position to succeed following injuriesThe individual failures I think you can separate from the coaching failures are the pass rushers Bosa and Mack started off last season very well but its been a long stretch now of them together but failing to produce at a high level Its not their fault alone because theyre both older yet stuck playing a high snap count with no useful depth behind them until Tuli develops further The team should seriously consider re-signing KVN to help out ASAP hes probably the best option to add emergency help for cheap and an instant rotational piece Im not abandoning all hope for the defense especially because they will not be playing against McDaniel and Tyreek every week the Dolphins have all the makings of am elite offense this year especially if Tua has taken the step forward he showed yesterday This Chargers secondary is way better than what happened yesterday so theyre my biggest reason for hope at the moment and Im still genuinely excited to see how they play throughout the year But the front seven is very thin and worrisome theyll need the rookies to step up immediately for helpIf this defense continues to struggle I sincerely hope Staley considers giving up in-game play calling Really think hes stretching himself too thin some weeks and should give his DCs a shot at it instead Im personally excited for Ansley too seems like a great personality and quickly rising startldr Bad game yesterday is more on the coaches than the players Front seven is worrying and pass rush might need immediate help should consider re-signing KVN If defense continues to fail Staley should give up in-game play calling,Chargers,14:37:04,0.9645,0.13,0.697,0.173
7029,2023-09-11,1694458896,2,I was really hoping for Payton after the Jaguars game I even had my flair as former Staley apologist Im holding off on guzzling the 23 bleach till at least five games in This is game one of our team being close to fully healthy at once I feel like we had one or two games at the start of last year like that before people started dropping Hopefully Eric Kendricks starts blending with the team and JC shakes off the rust and can return to 80 form Im not defending Staley Im just sharing why the seal on my Clorox isnt broken yet Staying in man coverage more than any other team yesterday was wild I cant even confidently say it was the most wild thing hes done because theres a tough list Staley is gonna get the full year regardless no matter what we think say or do so we just gotta chill or stop watching if we wanna play pretend and act like weve never been through having our souls snatched before and its so shocking and different all of a suddenKellen Moores offense compared to the Lombo shit was a night and day difference,Chargers,15:01:36,0.8031,0.08,0.812,0.108
7030,2023-09-11,1694465614,2,Honestly at least it was game 1  Now I can certainly move on with zero expectations  If we win awesome  If not well Im expecting 8-9 and missing the playoffs so its all good  Sad to see us waste Herbert but it is what it is  Does anyone else feel like if they waste Herberts career like they did Rivers they will be done as a Charger fan?

7033,2023-09-12,1694494666,2,My thoughts of the game areDefense played horribly  No way to hide it There was absolutely no pressure on tua despite having bosa and mack The only reason bosa was mentioned was because of the penalties he caused The turnovers we got were mostly blunders by the dolphins except for the interception we got on at the end zone in which  I cant wrap my head around why JC Jackson decided to run it out of the end zone instead of taking a knee and having it be a touchback Come on man you know better than thatOffensively is was great The offense ran really well and for the most part where able to drive down the field and get points It did seem to me like the players were still adjusting to the new offense during the pass game but overall we put up 34 points which is great Only thing is that we had the ball with 2 min left this is what I was waiting for To see Justin Herbert lead a last minute comeback Unfortunately that didnt happen Seemed like the offense choked at the end and Herbert messed up with the intentional grounding Again still adjusting to new offense Overall Im happy with the team the way it played Except defensely The dolphins have a great offense sure but the defense still should have played better On paper it looks like we shouldve won But its only the first game Looking forward to the boltz coming out strong for the second game ,Chargers,0:57:46,0.9842,0.092,0.728,0.18
7034,2023-09-11,1694447393,2,Im not so upset about that game this morning Week 1 you have no idea what to expect so youre kinda just guessing Going into a game with two elite WRs where its 3 steps and the ball is out was a great game plan to hide the OL trouble Chargers were literally a dumb JC PI away from winning the game Still have 16 more Fully expecting to be 2-2/ 3-1 going into the bye,Chargers,11:49:53,0.3294,0.111,0.774,0.115

7036,2023-09-11,1694451335,2,I feel like zero pressures is misleading I though Tua moved around the pocket really well yesterday to avoid pressure personally Dont get me wrong I feel like they could have done more to generate sacks more stunts blitzes etc but cant discredit how Tua played to not take hits,Chargers,12:55:35,0.5225,0.116,0.71,0.174
7037,2023-09-11,1694451680,2,But we know Burrow starts slow especially if hes not 100 difference is he rallies This defense has consistently put up crap tape and effort weekly going into the third year now,Chargers,13:01:20,-0.3533,0.096,0.849,0.055

7043,2023-09-11,1694454562,2,Last years answer to Tyreek was Tua still suffering from early season head knocks and being woefully inaccurate for most of the game Hill was still getting open Tua just missed him constantlyGameplan was still more effective than yesterday but people need to go back and watch that Miami game from last season again and see how bad Tua wasTua also looks like hes improved his arm-strength significantly in the off-season He was throwing with far more zip and less arc on his short and intermediate stuff yesterday than Ive ever seen him before One of the issues last season was that he had to throw to spots due to a lack of zip so when he was off like in our game it was really off He had no trouble with that yesterday,Chargers,13:49:22,0.5474,0.086,0.811,0.103

7086,2023-09-11,1694395659,2,Thats certainly part of it but even when he did pass he rarely made big plays Herbert had only 7 completions longer than 10 yards and of those only 3 were for more than 20 yards and one of those was the dump off to Ekeler in the flat who ran without contact for over 30 yardsObviously giving up over 200 yards on the ground is going to be a problem but Im also pretty confident that we wont face too many teams with an offensive line as good as the Chargers who also have a back as elusive as Ekeler Well see how we do against the Patriots next week since theyll figure to try and expose our run defense again,miamidolphins,21:27:39,0.7711,0.102,0.75,0.148

7360,2023-09-11,1694471856,2,I disagree While I think we looked better than last year the formula of this game was almost identical to many games last year We go down early and have to dig ourselves out We make up some ground but cant quite overcome the early deficit and ultimately come up short Beyond the Bears game last year our biggest lost was against Buffalo by only 14 points Most of our loses were within 1 score We always play close to our competition and stay in games late Its the coming up short at the end that weve been doing for 3 years now,Patriots,18:37:36,-0.7647,0.102,0.853,0.044

7364,2023-09-11,1694452667,2,Probably unpopular opinion since we should generally have good vibes about the team going forward and I do&but we win that game if Hopkins is out there The rookies are talented but are going to keep making rookie mistakes and Bourne is good but boy did that tip wreck the momentum Having a great reliable playmaking vet wouldve made a world of difference,Patriots,13:17:47,0.836,0.09,0.708,0.202

7372,2023-09-10,1694383016,2,I think both defenses were pretty gassed Towards the end though the saints offense started to cook Gave them some time off the field Interesting game regardless Atleast both teams kickers got a lot of practice,Saints,17:56:56,0.6808,0.048,0.769,0.183

7379,2023-09-11,1694427670,2,Carr was a beast when the Raiders had Henry Ruggs DC can bomb it out as good as anyone in the NFL If you give him options in the slot and deep hell usually find someone I said it before the game If the OL gives him hope the first 5 mins in the game he will settle in and be great Unfortunately Penning was more or less a lamppost early and so it took way longer for him to go,Saints,6:21:10,-0.0772,0.107,0.789,0.104

8273,2023-09-10,1694382868,1,2 totally different situationsGoing to Heinicke on the bench you are going to a vet that has shown he can win games and has experience in a similar offenseLast year with Mariota  You are trying to get a playoff spot maybe win the division and if you pull Mariota you are going to a guy that has never taken a snap in the NFL outside of preseason Not just the qb situation but the expectations are different this year also  Blank wants a winning record Many are saying they have the talent to win the division and Smith has a bit more heat under his chair where last year there was none and no expectationsSo yea its totally different scenarios across the board so definitely would not rule out seeing Heinicke as a possibility Yea Mariota was shit last year but he didnt have like 25 passing yards in a half  Ridder cannot have a half of football like that again without gettin benched  Or the media will start cooking SmithAlso have to take into consideration how deep the QB class is for the next draft and the fact that the most qb needy teams aside from arizona drafted qbs in the past draft So there will be talent within grasp They arent as chained to ridder as it seems tbh I think they are going to draft a qb in 24 regardless tbh cause of how much talent is there Especially with an extra 2nd round pick,falcons,17:54:28,0.9775,0.039,0.833,0.128

8275,2023-09-10,1694383602,1,They arent calling plays the way they are calling them for no reasonNot to mention how uncomfortable he looked out there the entire first half dude was a deer in headlightsWhat changed in the second half was they started calling plays that got him outside the pocket cause he wasnt doing it himself He is going to have to learn to use his mobility outside the pocket or he wont have a job anywhere much less here Also you act like he had 0 opportunities  Thats not true They def werent letting him air it out but come on dude was like 8 of 9 for 30 fucking yards at some point The play calling was trying to push him to create on his own he couldnt so the play calling changed to make him move outside the pocket in the 2nd half and he got better  He has to learn to move out of the pocket and beat man coverage by running at some point or he wont last long in the league He arm is not good enough to not be a dual threatOnce teams see him freezing up in the pocket like that on tape life is going to be a lot more difficult for him Especially if he doesnt make them fear him as a runner  He has the speed just not the ambition Very little dawg in him Like a chihuahua or something lol,falcons,18:06:42,0.9417,0.066,0.817,0.117

LOL He named him starter with four starts and gave him QB1 reps in camp and treated him like a vet in the preseason This is big boy football You have to produce Period Maybe Ridder shouldnt look like a first play rookie when he takes his first snap next game Smith is holding his development back? You mean by giving him the best running game that doesnt account for QB as a rusher What a travesty What are you even talking about If he cant dink and dunk and make some shot plays with that kind of running game then he isnt the guy and they will move on Hes going to be given a chance Its up to him to produce and improve,falcons,17:24:28,0.938,0.039,0.812,0.15

8282,2023-09-10,1694387710,1,Right This is a fair take in my opinion We do not need him to be Joe or Pat Mahomes He just needs to make passes here and there and not make mistakes The issue with Marcus is that he would always make a huge mistake when we were close to winning whether it was a fumble or an interception,falcons,19:15:10,0.7724,0.036,0.815,0.15
8283,2023-09-10,1694384619,1,Yea man Like every throw was late And some of these are like 5 or 6 yards Tosses not throws Point blank dude was a nervous wreck and didnt calm down until the second half when they adjusted the calls to get him outside the pocketPlay design like that and some designed runs can hopefully prevent another half like that from ever happening again  But i just dont know about this as a long term investmentI think we draft someone next year regardless because the draft class is strong 2 qbs on a rookie contract is good money wise  There are several guys that fit the offense perfectly Competition is always good  And we  are going to have an extra 2nd round  pick,falcons,18:23:39,0.9813,0.05,0.715,0.235

8324,2023-09-10,1694384798,1,Taking a knee would literally have been better than the Zay screen in terms of win probability Im sure What are the chances Zay covers 15 yards on that 3rd down screen and gets a TD even if it was more successful than it ended up being? And does him scoring a TD there even provide that much of a higher win probability than just taking a knee and kicking for 3? Either way we are winning the game short of some record breaking level one in a million comeback But at least taking a knee has a near 0 percent chance of a play going disastrously wrong Taking a knee guarantees negative 1 yard though whereas a Gus run has a small chance of gaining yards or even a TD But I dont necessarily have a problem with taking a knee other than it probably having bad optics Especially when you consider we probably snapped shotgun on that screen cant rewatch the play with a backup center? It makes no sense to pass there and risk a huge momentum changing play or a stopped clock to achieve the same result Tucker FG securing the game 99 percent of the time as if we just handed it off or even took a knee,ravens,18:26:38,-0.4305,0.111,0.758,0.131

Is he too old now? Does he still love ball? Can he win outside of GB? Dudes were acting like Rodgers was winning NFC titles every year and it was Super Bowl rings waiting for us as soon as he would get here Nothing is ever guaranteed case and point what happened monday night For what LV wouldve had to give up to get him it better be damn near guaranteed  To me Jimmy G was the better decision for the team and it wasnt even close,raiders,12:48:52,0.929,0.096,0.742,0.161

9187,2023-09-11,1694458349,1,Yeah its hard to sort out exactly what was going on with the passing offense I think the biggest reason why they passed less is just because of how good the running game was those offensive linemen were dominant bullies yesterday helping Ekeler and Kelley average 65 yards a clip With the added benefit of keeping Miamis offense off the field it made sense to go run heavy For the passing offense Im personally just chalking it up to the starters showing some rust and the debut of an offense that will take time to gel Herbert had some uncharacteristic throws that sailed over players heads makes me wondering if his non-throwing shoulder surgery is also affecting him and needs some further rehabIt was exciting to see Keenan still playing at a high level including deep Mike Williams came through when he needed to as well But Im very curious to see if hes a good fit in Moores scheme I was personally worried we would see him decline after being such an excellent fit under Lombardis offense The tight ends were the most promising group besides the running backs I thought Parham and Everett played very well in passing and even McKitty looked better than he ever has as a blocker Titans passing defense was not good against the Saints so that could be a promising matchup for Herbert and the WRs to get back on track,Chargers,14:52:29,0.9878,0.064,0.755,0.181

9329,2023-09-11,1694451142,1,Offense looked awesome after the first quarter Had some penalties drops and bad coaching decisions which hurt but Mac was one of our best players maybe the best considering the inexperienced oline and average receivers Id argue he carried our offense like Brady used to,Patriots,12:52:22,0.8705,0.178,0.554,0.268

9335,2023-09-11,1694438392,1,I mean ya I can understand thats why we didnt take that \55 yard shot on that 4th and 8 where Henry made the sick catch But if you dont have confidence in your kicker to take 35 yard shots in tough weatherthen why are we trading a seasoned pro who went 5/5 with a long of 50?

9338,2023-09-10,1694382214,1,I see the reasoning but I just think its dumb Regardless of what happened on that drive FG turnover on downs touchdown the Titans wouldve needed a stop on the following drive Even if they got the TD theyd only be up by 3 so the Saints could tie or take the lead on next drive They dont get a stop theyre doomed regardless of what they did on the 4th down in question A field goal guarantees that the Saints get a possession with a substantial amount of time on the clock Thats not good These are the possible outcomes if they go for it 1 They get the first down and get a fresh set of downs at 1st and goal 2 Theres a Titans penalty that blows the play dead if so they can turn around and kick the FG3 Theres a Saints penalty that blows the play dead but may lead to automatic 1st down or makes it 4th and 1 4 They dont get the first down and they have the Saints pinned inside their 10 yard line 5 Theres a fumble or an INT but with those its still very likely that the Saints are inside their own 20 Really the only truly bad thing that couldve happened on that play for the Titans was an INT where the Saints defender ran it back for a substantial number of yards An INT only still gives them field position inside their 10 Theres really not much of a risk in giving the ball to Derrick Henry and seeing what he can do there Also takes time off the clock,Saints,17:43:34,-0.9686,0.133,0.776,0.09

Sure Id bet on our guys converting as opposed to the extra distance for the opponent to have to drive in a 2 min drill But against Mac Jones I disagree I still feel we had control of the game regardless but it was a bit arrogant considering how poorly the offense had been executing since the first quarter,eagles,21:56:06,-0.9012,0.154,0.828,0.017
9646,2023-09-11,1694398931,1,Idk Mac was kinda tearing us apart after the first quarter and had zero issue driving down the field We ended up lucking out that the receiver didnt have good footwork on the sidelineI agree with going for the kill shot as they had no issue moving the ball especially between the 20s The defense was also gassedTime is barely an issue with 2 minutes left nowadays 30 yards is like 2 decent completions which they were consistently getting,eagles,22:22:11,-0.4599,0.118,0.785,0.096

Once that ball slipped out of Burrows hand when he tried to throw to the flat you have to recognize this game was going to be a classic AFC North slobber knocker and run the ball Plus the situational play calling was horrendous Ill have to go back and watch but they punted at in Cleveland territory multiple times and/or threw long on 3rd and short In Zacs 5th year I still feel like we are watching a 1st year coach at times,bengals,21:34:45,0.986,0.057,0.78,0.163
